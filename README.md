# PTW-accelerometer-dataset
This dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope readings of a Powered Two -wheeler during various riding intervals.
# Two-Wheeler Fall Detection Dataset

This repository contains a labeled dataset collected from a single-person-ridden two-wheeler to analyze and classify different riding conditions: **Fall**, **Near Fall**, and **Normal** scenarios. The data is especially useful for research and development in the fields of **vehicular safety**, **accident detection systems**, and **smart mobility solutions**.

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset includes sensor readings captured during various two-wheeler ride scenarios using an onboard device. It features time-series data from:

- **Accelerometer** on three axes: `Accel_X`, `Accel_Y`, `Accel_Z`
- **Gyroscope** on three axes: `Gyro_X`, `Gyro_Y`, `Gyro_Z`

Each reading is labeled as one of the following:
- `Fall`: Complete fall or crash of the two-wheeler
- `Near Fall`: Skidding, slipping, or near-fall situations
- `Normal`: Normal riding or idling conditions
